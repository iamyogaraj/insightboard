# Driver Matching & MVR Classification Streamlit App

## Overview

This is a multi-functional Streamlit web application designed to assist with driver data management and Motor Vehicle Record (MVR) violation classification. It features advanced fuzzy name matching techniques to compare driver names from multiple Excel datasets, enrich driver information, and help classify violation descriptions based on a reference violation dataset.

The app is built with user experience in mind, featuring a dark-themed UI and a sidebar navigation menu to switch between various tools.
